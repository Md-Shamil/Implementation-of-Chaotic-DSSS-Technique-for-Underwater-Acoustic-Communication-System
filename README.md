# Implementation-of-Chaotic-DSSS-Technique-for-Underwater-Acoustic-Communication-System
Underwater comms using chaotic DSSS with Logistic map-based BPSK. Offers better security, Doppler resilience, and noise robustness. Simulated in MATLAB for ocean environments with Gaussian noise and multipath effects. Ideal for marine and surveillance use.
