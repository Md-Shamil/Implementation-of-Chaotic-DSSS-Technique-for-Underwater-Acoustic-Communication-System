# Implementation-of-Chaotic-DSSS-Technique-for-Underwater-Acoustic-Communication-System
Chaotic DSSS-based underwater acoustic communication using Logistic map for secure BPSK modulation, Doppler shift compensation (±10 m/s), and robust performance in noisy, dynamic channels. MATLAB simulations show improved stealth, efficiency, and eco-friendliness.

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of a Chaotic Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) system for *underwater acoustic communication. The system replaces traditional pseudo-random sequences with *chaotic sequences to enhance signal security and randomness in low-bandwidth, noisy environments

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Implement a DSSS system using chaotic sequences generated by the logistic map.
- Model a basic underwater communication scenario using Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN).
- Simulate *security threats* like:
  - 📡 **Jamming**: Intentional interference injected into the channel.
  - 🕵️ **Eavesdropping**: Unauthorized attempts to decode the transmitted message.
